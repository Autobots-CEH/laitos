## Introduction
Via any of enabled laitos daemons, you may run operating system (shell) commands and read the response.

## Configuration
This app is always available for use and does not require configuration.

However, if you wish to override the automatic detection of system shell interpreter, then navigate to JSON
object `Features` and construct a JSON object called `Shell` with the following properties:
<table>
<tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>InterpreterPath</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>
        Absolute path to shell interpreter program, such as /bin/bash
        <br/>
        If left empty, laitos will automatically find a working shell program already installed on the computer.
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

Here is an example:
<pre>
{
    ...

    "Features": {
        ...

        "Shell": {
            "InterpreterPath": "/bin/bash"
        },
        ...
    },

    ...
}
</pre>


## Usage
Use any capable laitos daemon to invoke the app:

    .s <shell command to run>

The shell command may use shell interpreter's capabilities to their full extend. For example, the following command will
find system users whose name contains "howard" and store them in an output file:

    .s cat /etc/passwd | grep howard > output.txt

## Tips
- When `InterpreterPath` is left empty, laitos will automatically look for a shell interpreter from `/bin`, `/usr/bin`,
  `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/bin`, in this order: `bash`, `dash`, `zsh`, `ksh`, `ash`, `tcsh`, `csh`, `sh`.
- On Windows, laitos uses PowerShell by default, unless an alternative shell interpreter is specified in configuration.
- When shell commands are run, the environment variable `PATH` is hard coded to
  `/tmp/laitos-util:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/libexec:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/opt/bin:/opt/sbin`
- `/tmp/laitos-util` is maintained by laitos internally to store non-essential components, such as a copy of PhantomJS
  software, a copy of BusyBox software, and a copy of ToyBox software.
