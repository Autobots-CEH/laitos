# Configuration

## Overview

laitos components go into two categories:
- Daemons - web and mail server, chat bots, etc.
- Features - access to Email, post to Twitter/Facebook, etc.

Every daemon grants you access to all features.
A text file written in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) supplies configuration to all components.

Write configuration for the daemons and features you plan to use. A component without configuration remains inactive.
