# Configuration

## Overview

laitos components go into two categories:
- Features - access to Email, post to Twitter/Facebook, etc.
- Daemons - web server, mail server, and chat bots. Daemons grant access to all features.

laitos uses a text file written in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) to configure all components.
As a start, make an empty text file and write down `{ }` - an empty JSON object.

Then go through the sections below to craft your very own configuration. Keep in mind - a component without configuration remains inactive.

After the configuration file is ready, laitos is [ready to run](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/laitos/wiki/Invocation).
